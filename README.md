## Project : Advertising-Spend-vs-Sales-Regression
Predicting product sales using advertising spend data and Linear Regression
# what is the problem ?
-> Many Bussinesses invest in multiple advertising platforms such as TV , Google Ads, Billboards, Social Media ,Influencers , Radio etc .
   however, it is not clear which platform actually drives the product sales and how much each contributes. Making the wrong marketing 
   decision can waste budget without improving outcomes.
# Solution :
-> I aim to build a Simple Linear Regression Model that :
         - Quantifies the relationship between advertising spend and product sales.
         - Identifies which channels are most impactful
         - Predicts future product sales based on marketing budgets

# Project Overview :
-> This project uses a dataset containing advertising spend across:
         - TV
         - Google Ads
         - Billboards
         - Social Media
         - Influencer Marketing
         - Affiliate Marketing
# The target variable is:  Products Sold (Numeric value)

We preprocess the data, apply multiple linear regression, and evaluate the model‚Äôs performance using:
 - # R¬≤ Score
 - # Mean Squared Error (MSE)

# Tools & Skills Demonstrated
 - Languages & Libraries:
                      -> Python
                      -> pandas
                      -> numpy
                      -> scikit-learn
                      -> matplotlib
                      -> seaborn
# Skills:
        -> Understanding of Linear Regression
        -> Model building and training
        -> Evaluation metrics: R¬≤ Score, MSE
        -> Data visualization
        -> One-hot encoding & preprocessing
        -> Google Colab environment
        
# Project Demonstration :
        -> Loaded and explored the dataset
        -> Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables
        -> Built and trained a Linear Regression model
        -> Evaluated model performance
        -> Plotted Actual vs Predicted product sales using "matplotlib"
